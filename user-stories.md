## User-Stories

* Marketing Team: From the marketing team. I want to create a program that will allow consumers to be able to choose products for purchase while in-transit to wherever they are going.
* Marketing Team: Only want to show top products purchased with displaying a set of 3 images the user can click on.

* Marketing Team: As a part of the results, we want to see the total number of clicks and the percentage of times an item(image) was clicked when it was displayed to the consumer.

* Developer: I want to create a new repo and work off of a branch(s). As I make progress, I will save to the branches and eventually merge into the master branch.
* Developer: I want to setup a console log throughout the code to test it for errors.
* Developers: I want to create a page that will cycle through a set of 3 images at a time. I want to store the values of total number of clicks and the percentage of times and item was clicked when shown. Need to keep count of how many times image is displayed and do the math.
